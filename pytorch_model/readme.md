# Directory Overview

This directory includes two parts of the project:

1. Implementation and running of the fully-supervised model in an attempt to recover the performance described in the paper.
2. Results analysis of the fully-supervised model to explore research directions for the project.

## Fully Supervised Model

### 1. Required Directories
Make sure this directory includes the following directories: `light_output` and `lightning_saved_params`.

### 2. Swell Dataset
The `swell_dict.npy` file should be located inside the `../pre_processing_and_recover_network/swell_dataset` folder.

### 3. Running the `light.ipynb` Notebook
Open the `light.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### 4. Notebook Sections
Run the notebook and follow the sections which include:
- Creation and training of the network
- Presentation of the results (loss and accuracy)
- General analysis of the results as an introduction to the Results Analysis section.

## Results Analysis

### 1. Running the `unite_classes_matrix_confusion_and_TSNE.ipynb` Notebook
Open the `unite_classes_matrix_confusion_and_TSNE.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### 2. Notebook Sections
Run the notebook section and follow the results analysis.
